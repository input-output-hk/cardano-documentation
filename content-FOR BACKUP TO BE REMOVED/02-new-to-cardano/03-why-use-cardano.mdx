[Cardano](https://cardano.org/) is an open source [proof-of-stake](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/proof-of-stake) blockchain project that began in 2015
to address existing blockchain challenges in the design and development of
cryptocurrencies. It aims to provide a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem
that better accounts for the needs of its users as well as other systems seeking
integration.

The first generation of blockchains (like Bitcoin) offered decentralized ledgers
for secure cryptocurrency transfer. However, such blockchains did not provide a
functional environment for complex deal settlement and decentralized application
(DApp) development. As blockchain technology matured, the second generation
(like Ethereum) provided more enhanced solutions for writing and executing smart
contracts, application development, and the creation of different token types.
On the other hand, the second generation of blockchains often faces issues in
terms of scalability.

Cardano is conceived as the third-generation blockchain as it combines the
properties of the prior generations and evolves to meet all the arising needs of
users. When comparing blockchain properties, many aspects should be considered.
Thus, the best solution must ensure the highest security, scalability
(transaction throughput, data scale, network bandwidth), and functionality
(besides transaction processing, the blockchain should provide all means for
business deal settlement). Moreover, it is important to ensure that blockchain
technology is constantly developing in terms of sustainability and is
interoperable with other blockchains and financial institutions.

To address these needs, Cardano focuses on such core concepts as:

- **Scalability** — ensures that the Cardano network is capable of processing an increasing
   number of transactions as user demand grows.
  Scalability also provides higher bandwidth capabilities to allow transactions
  to carry a significant amount of supportive data that can be easily managed
  within the network. For these needs, Cardano is implementing various
  techniques (like data compression for instance) and is working to introduce
  [Hydra](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/hydrafast-isomorphic-state-channels/),
  which will enable multiple side chains functionality.
- **Interoperability** — ensures the most multi-functional environment for
  financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact
  not only with one type of currency, but with multiple currencies across
  various blockchains. Moreover, interoperability with centralized banking
  entities is as important to grant legitimacy and convenience of use. Cardano
  is being developed to support cross-chain transfers, multiple token types, and
  commonly used smart contracts languages.
- **Sustainability** — designing a proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital
  to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive growth and maturity in
  a truly decentralized manner, Cardano is built to allow the community to
  maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and
  implementing system improvements. To ensure sustainability, the treasury
  system is controlled by the community and is refilled constantly from
  potential sources such as newly-minted coins being held back as funding, a
  percentage of stake pool rewards, and transaction fees.

### Cardano advantages

- **Academic research** — formal methods, such as mathematical specifications,
  property-based tests, and proofs, are the best way to deliver high assurance
  software systems and give confidence to users for the management of digital
  funds. Cardano has been built using formal methods to achieve strong
  guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system. All
  of the research and technical specifications that underpin Cardano are
  publicly available, and all Cardano development activity is published online.
- **System design** — Cardano is written in Haskell, a secure functional
  programming language that encourages building a system using pure functions,
  which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in
  isolation. Furthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable us to employ a
  whole range of powerful methods for ensuring correctness of the code, such as
  basing the implementation on formal and executable specifications, extensive
  property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.
- **Security** —
  [Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/)
  (the Cardano proof-of-stake protocol) establishes rigorous security
  guarantees; it was delivered with several peer-reviewed papers presented in
  top-tier conferences and publications in the area of cybersecurity and
  cryptography.
- **Energy efficiency** — Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain. In contrast to
  proof-of-work blockchains, [Cardano requires much less energy](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/17/why-they-re-calling-cardano-the-green-blockchain/) and computational
  power. The Bitcoin network is secured through computers doing
  ever-more-energy-intensive computations – proof of work – which is
  unsustainable in the long term. Cambridge University has an online tool that
  shows the [computers powering Bitcoin](https://cbeci.org/) already consume
  more electricity than some countries, like [Switzerland](https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/en/home/supply/statistics-and-geodata/energy-statistics/overall-energy-statistics.html) for example.
- **Seamless upgrades** — traditionally, blockchains upgrade using hard forks.
  When conducting a hard fork, the current protocol would stop operating, new
  rules and changes would be implemented, and the chain would restart – with its
  previous history being erased. Cardano handles hard forks differently. Instead
  of implementing radical changes, the Cardano
  [hard-fork combinator technology](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/05/07/combinator-makes-easy-work-of-shelley-hard-fork/)
  ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol while saving the history of the
  previous blocks and not causing any disruptions for end users.
- **Decentralization** — Cardano is maintained by almost 3,000 distributed stake
  pools that are operated by the community. All blocks and transactions are validated by
  network participants without any reliance on a centralized authority.
- **Functional environment for business use cases** — Cardano is establishing a
  foundation for global, decentralized finance to develop a range of DApps that
  can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts, providing
  multi-asset tokens for any needs. 

### Cardano development themes

[Cardano’s development journey](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/) has been split
into five main themes focusing on such core functionalities as:

- Byron — foundation establishment
- Shelley — decentralization
- Goguen — smart contracts
- Basho — scalability
- Voltaire — governance

Each theme is centered around a set of functionalities that are being delivered
across multiple code releases. While these development streams are delivered
sequentially, the work for each happens in parallel – with research,
prototyping, and development often in progress all at once across the different
stages. Let’s take a closer look at these development themes.

**Byron**

Byron set the foundation for Cardano development allowing users to buy and sell
ada on a proof-of-stake blockchain network. Initially, the Cardano ledger was
established as a federated network, where block production and transaction
validation were maintained by Input Output Global (the company that develops
Cardano technology) and [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/) (the company that drives Cardano commercial
adoption) stake pools. Byron saw the delivery of [Daedalus](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/daedalus-wallet) and Yoroi wallets, and
also provided users with a Block Explorer ‒ a tool specifically designed for
browsing the blockchain.

**Shelley**

The Shelley development theme introduced a decentralized ledger creating a
completely new economic system, which drives the network’s growth and gradual
optimization. Shelley evolved from Byron’s federated network maintenance, with
more and more blocks being produced by the distributed stake pool operator
community. This theme focuses on a number of critical steps that ensure enhanced
user experience in terms of stake pool operation, delegation preferences, and
incentives. As a proof-of-stake network, Cardano Shelley introduced the
Incentivized Testnet (ITN) which proved that the blockchain can be sustainable
in the long term by relying exclusively on community-managed pools.

**Goguen**

Goguen development focuses on the establishment of a global, financial and
multi-functional system for decentralized application (DApp) building, smart
contract support, and custom token issuance. Goguen is a key building block to
establish a versatile platform to build solutions around such application
domains as supply chain, track and trace, finance, medical records, identity
voting, property registration, P2P payments, and many others.

**Basho**

Basho will focus on Cardano’s optimization in terms of improving the scalability
and interoperability of the network. Whereas other development stages focus on
decentralization and new functionality, Basho is about improving the underlying
performance of the Cardano network to better support growth and adoption for
applications with high transaction volume.

**Voltaire**

Decentralized governance and decision making lie at the heart of Voltaire
granting the Cardano community an ability to vote on network development
updates, technical improvements, and project funding. For the Cardano network to
become truly decentralized, it requires not only the distributed infrastructure
introduced during Shelley but also the capacity to be maintained and improved
over time in a decentralized way.
