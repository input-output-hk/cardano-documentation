# Overview

Building web3 apps has never been easier. [Mesh](https://meshjs.dev/) is a complete development framework for developers to easily bring their application onto web3. Whether you're a new developer, a startup, or a large enterprise; Mesh makes Web3 development easy with reliable, scalable, and well-engineered APIs & developer tools.

The idea for Mesh first came about when we recognized a gap in the developer experience within the Cardano ecosystem. We noticed that there was a lack of proper documentation and tools available. Many developers were struggling to get their projects off the ground. This was frustrating and disheartening, as we strongly believed that building on Cardano should not be such a difficult and convoluted process.
 
Thus, we were motivated to fill this gap for developers to onboard into the ecosystem. So, we created this software developer kit, Mesh, that provided the necessary resources and support for developers so that they could focus on building innovative and impactful applications.

# Mesh Features

# Getting Started on Web3 Development with Mesh

There are multiple ways to get started with Mesh:
- [Starter Kits](#starter-kits)
- [Guides](#guides)
- [Migration or Manual Installation](#migration-manual-installation)

## Starter Kits

The easiest way to get started with Mesh is to use one of the [Starter Kits](https://meshjs.dev/starter-templates). 

For example, if you are an NFT project and wants to start your own multi-sig minting website, you can use the [Multi-sig Minting Starter Kit](https://minting-template.meshjs.dev/).

Or, if you are a stake pool operator, this [Pool Operator Portal Starter Kit](https://staking-template.meshjs.dev/) allows delegators to connect their wallet and stake with your pool.

Explore and choose from a collection of open-source [Starter Kits](https://meshjs.dev/starter-templates).

### Install with CLI

To start the installation, open your Terminal and run the following CLI command:

```shell
npx create-mesh-app your-app name
```

You will be prompted with a few questions, you can pick one of the templates, choose a framework and select the language of your choice. The entire process should take less than 1 minute.
