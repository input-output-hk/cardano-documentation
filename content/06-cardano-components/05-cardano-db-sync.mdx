Cardano DB Sync is one of the core Cardano components, which provides a convenient way to find and query historical information from the Cardano blockchain through the use of a Structured Query Language (SQL) relational database. Db Sync connects to the local node as a client and synchronizes with the on-chain activity.

## About Cardano DB Sync and its components

DB Sync can be used by Cardano users and developers who wish to find out
specific details in regards to block production and recent transactions. These
details include block information that enables users to follow the chain and
explore transactions within blocks, but exclude cryptographic signatures.

### Architecture of Cardano DB Sync

Cardano-db-sync consists of a set of components:

- `cardano-db` – defines common data types and functions used by any application
  that needs to interact with the database from Haskell. In particular, it
  defines the database schema.
- `cardano-db-tool` – a tool used to manage cardano-db-sync databases (create,
  run, validate and analyze migrations).
- `cardano-db-sync` – acts as a Cardano node, following the chain and inserting
  data from the chain into a PostgreSQL database.
- `cardano-db-sync-extended` – a relatively simple extension to cardano-db-sync,
  which maintains an extra table containing epoch data.
- `db-sync-node` – designed to work with a locally running Cardano Node to store
  data in the PostgreSQL database.

The two versions `cardano-db-sync` and `cardano-db-sync-extended` are fully
compatible and use identical database schemas. The only difference is that the
extended version maintains an `Epoch` table, which the non-extended version will
also create but _not_ maintain.

The `db-sync-node` is written in a highly modular fashion to allow it to be as
flexible as possible. It connects to a locally running cardano-node (i.e., the
one connected to other nodes in the Cardano network over the internet with
TCP/IP) using a Unix domain socket. Db-sync-node retrieves blocks, updates its
internal ledger state, and stores parts of each block in a local PostgreSQL
database.

#### PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a generic relational database used
for the mapping of on-chain information to a relational model. It addresses
specific user needs and requirements using the normalization technique to store
relational data without duplication.

The following diagram outlines the interaction between the system components:

![db-sync-architecture](https://ucarecdn.com/0a179e23-8258-48f8-8204-339e5233cce6/)

GraphQL and REST API export an interface to the data stored in the database to
be accessed from spreadsheets, for example.
[Frontend explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en) is the most user-oriented
tool; it fetches data from the main database and reflects it in a
straightforward and convenient web interface. Another component, the SMASH
server, aggregates stake pool metadata and provides pool operators and
delegators with a list of valid stake pools with verified metadata.

#### GraphQL API Server (Apollo)

The GraphQL API provides a query interface to all the blockchain data via
GraphQL, which is a convenient choice for client applications based on web
technologies (applications written in JavaScript, or any other browser-based
languages, for example) that use HTTP/REST APIs to talk to other services. It is
an alternative to the database SQL interface. Application developers can choose
between SQL and GraphQL for accessing the chain data.

The implementation of the API is based on the Apollo Server, an open-source,
spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client
(including the Apollo Client).

#### REST API Components

There are two Cardano components that provide an HTTP REST API for interacting
with a local node:

- A dedicated transaction submission component, which has a single endpoint for
  submitting transactions.
- A query component to access blockchain data. This is a legacy component
  provided to aid migration from the Byron era. Any applications currently using
  it should plan to migrate to the GraphQL API or the SQL interface.

The rationale for this is that the REST API is deprecated, so there is no reason
for new applications to use it for querying chain data. The submission API is,
for now, the only HTTP based API for tx submission, as GraphQL does not yet
support tx submission, so any application authors that want to use web-tech APIs
(rather than scripting APIs or low level or Haskell APIs) can use the REST API
for tx submission.

#### Stake Pool Metadata Aggregation Server (SMASH)

The purpose of the [Stake Pool Metadata Aggregation Server (SMASH)](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/smash) is to
aggregate off-chain metadata that stake pools provide when they register on the
Cardano blockchain. This metadata includes the name of the stake pool, its
ticker name, web homepage, and so on.

The rationale for a metadata aggregation server in the Cardano architecture is
two-fold:

1. To keep the stake pool metadata stored off-chain; and
2. To retain the ability to moderate stake pool metadata, without any
   centralized censor.

The metadata is hosted off-chain and referred to from the on-chain pool
registration. SMASH collects the off-chain data to make it more convenient,
performant, and reliable for wallets and other applications to access it.

The SMASH server also addresses the desire to moderate the content of stake pool
metadata without a centralized censoring entity. For example, most wallet users
and stake pool operators would like to have the ability to treat stake pool
ticker names as if they were unique trademarks. It would be too complex to have
a fair, on-chain system to resolve ticker name disputes. Instead of enforcing
uniqueness on chain, this can optionally be enforced by filtering as part of
metadata aggregation. Multiple aggregation services can be run by different
organizations following different policies on filtering stake pool metadata.
This enables wallet users and other consumers of stake pool metadata to choose
which policy to follow, if any.

SMASH can be configured with policies to filter out metadata based on block
lists or reserved ticker names. Daedalus can be configured to use any SMASH
server.
