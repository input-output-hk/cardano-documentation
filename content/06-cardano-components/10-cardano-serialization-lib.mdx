This is a library for serialization and deserialization of data structures used in Cardano’s Haskell implementation of Shelley along with useful utility functions.

## Using the library

Due to the portability of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), you can bind to the native Rust library from any common programming language (including C and WebAssembly). This library generates both [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) type definitions, and you can check out possible options by just looking at [Flow types](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib/blob/master/rust/pkg/cardano_serialization_lib.js.flow). You can also explore the [example folder](https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib/tree/master/example) to see how to use this library from Typescript and experiment with it.

### Benefits of using this library

Serialization/deserialization code is automatically generated from Cardano’s official specification, which guarantees it can easily stay up to date. This is enabled due to the use of an EMURGO-written tool called [cddl-codegen](https://github.com/Emurgo/cddl-codegen), which can be re-used for other tasks such as the automatic generation of a Rust library for Cardano [metadata](https://docs.cardano.org/glossary#metadata) specifications.

It is also easy to create scripts in Rust or WASM to share with stake pools, or even embed inside an online tool. The library is powerful and flexible enough to be used to power wallets and exchanges.

## Getting started with React

By default webpack does not support wasm. To use this libary you have to setup up a wasm loader. For this react setup we have to override the settings of react-scripts with CRACO. For react you have to do the following:
Add [CRACO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@craco/craco) and [wasm-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wasm-loader) to your package.json.
```
yarn add @craco/craco wasm-loader
```
Create craco.config.js:
```
const { addBeforeLoader, loaderByName } = require('@craco/craco');

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    configure: (webpackConfig) => {
      const wasmExtensionRegExp = /\.wasm$/;
      webpackConfig.resolve.extensions.push('.wasm');

      webpackConfig.module.rules.forEach((rule) => {
        (rule.oneOf || []).forEach((oneOf) => {
          if (oneOf.loader && oneOf.loader.indexOf('file-loader') >= 0) {
            oneOf.exclude.push(wasmExtensionRegExp);
          }
        });
      });

      const wasmLoader = {
        test: /\.wasm$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loaders: ['wasm-loader'],
      };

      addBeforeLoader(webpackConfig, loaderByName('file-loader'), wasmLoader);

      return webpackConfig;
    },
  },
};
```

Modify the scripts in package.json to use craco instead of react-scripts:
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "craco start",
    "build": "craco build",
    "test": "craco test",
    "eject": "craco eject"
  }
```

import the WASM code using await import(...) instead of import * as ...:
```
useEffect(() => {
    async function start() {
      const wasm = await import('@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-browser');
    }
    start();
  }, []);
```
or if you use a class component import it in componentDidMount and add it to your state:
```
componentDidMount() {
    import(
      "@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-browser/cardano_serialization_lib.js"
    ).then((wasm) => this.setState({ wasm: wasm }));
  }
 ```
