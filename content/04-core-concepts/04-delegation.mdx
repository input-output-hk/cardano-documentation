As Cardano is a proof-of-stake system, owning ada not only allows you to buy
goods or services, but also confers upon you the right and obligation to
participate in the protocol and create blocks. Delegation of stake is a
mechanism inherent in the Cardano proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol that allows the
protocol to scale even in a setting where the set of stakeholders is highly
fragmented.

Anyone who owns ada can participate in the delegation of stake process while
retaining their spending power. Note that you can spend your ada normally at any
time, regardless of how you delegated it. This mechanism will enable
stakeholders to participate in the slot leader election process in each epoch.

Stake delegation gives rise to “stake pools” that act in the similar way to
mining pools in the Bitcoin protocol. Stake pool operators must be online in
order to generate blocks when they are selected as slot leaders.

### Stake delegation requirements

Delegating stake requires posting two certificates to the chain: a staking
address registration, and a delegation certificate. Posting certificates
requires funds, so a user setting up their first wallet will need a
bootstrapping mechanism. This mechanism relies on the possibility of base
addresses using a staking key before posting the registration certificate for
that key. Note that the stake address can be based either on a single key or on
a script such as multi-sig.

### Delegation scheme

With the concept of delegation, any stakeholder can allow a stake pool to
generate blocks for the Cardano network and then the rewards will be paid by the
protocol for all participants including the fees for the stake pool operators. A
stake holder delegates to a particular pool ID, which is the hash of the
operator's verification key.

In order to limit the delegate’s block generation power to a certain range of
epochs and slots, the stakeholder can limit the proxy signing key’s valid
message space to strings ending with a slot number in a specific range of
values. This simple scheme is secure due to the verifiability and prevention of
misuse properties of proxy signature schemes. This ensures that any stakeholder
can verify that a proxy signing key was actually issued by a specific
stakeholder to a specific delegate and that the delegate can only use these keys
to sign messages inside the key’s valid message space, respectively.

The funds belonging to one staking key of a user’s wallet requires posting a
single transaction, containing a delegation certificate. This will only incur
the usual transaction fees. In particular, a stake holder needs to pay a deposit
for registering a stake address and not for the stake delegation itself. Once a
stake address is registered, the stake holder wiil only pay fees to set the
delegation choice.

Note that the stake holder's stake will count for the pool's stake during the
reward calculation.

### Stake delegation scenario

Imagine a user who is about to receive their first ada,for example through
redemption, from a trade on an exchange, or some other source. They will set up
a new wallet, and create an address to receive those funds. This address will be
a base address, using a staking key that is generated by the wallet, but not yet
registered on the chain.

After receiving the initial funds, the user can then participate in staking, by
posting a staking key registration certificate, as well as a delegation
certificate for their staking key. Once the key is registered, newly created
addresses can be pointer addresses to the staking key registration certificate.
