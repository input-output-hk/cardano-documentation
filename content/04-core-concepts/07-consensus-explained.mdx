Consensus is the process by which a majority opinion is reached by everyone who
is involved in running the blockchain. Agreement must be made on which blocks to
produce, which chain to adopt, and to determine the single state of the network.
The consensus protocol determines how individual nodes assess the current state
of the ledger system and reach a consensus. It has three main responsibilities;
to perform a leader check and decide if a block should be produced, to handle
chain selection, and to verify blocks that are produced.

Blockchains create consensus by allowing participants to bundle transactions
that others have submitted to the system in _blocks_, and add them to their
_chain_ (sequence of blocks). Determining who is allowed to produce a block
when, and what to do in case of conflicts, (such as two participants adding
different blocks at the same point of the chain), is the purpose of the
different consensus protocols. Our ground-breaking proof-of-stake consensus
protocol
[Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/06/23/the-ouroboros-path-to-decentralization/)
is proven to have the same security guarantees that proof of work has. Rigorous
security guarantees are established by Ouroboros and it was delivered with
several peer-reviewed papers that were presented in top-tier conferences and
publications in the area of cybersecurity and cryptography. Different
[implementations of Ouroboros](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/03/23/from-classic-to-hydra-the-implementations-of-ouroboros-explained/)
have been developed. For further details on each flavour of Ouroboros, you can
