Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano. We have an
active Telegram channel and a dedicated
[support page](https://iohk.zendesk.com/) to help you with your issues and
questions.

We are also creating documentation with the support of our pioneers, a small
group of stake pool operators. As that documentation is completed, we will add
it to the sections on this website. Please remember to check back regularly.

# Telegram Channel: Cardano Developers

You can reach the developers of Cardano directly on the Telegram website. Just
join the
[@CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup channel](https://t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup).

# Where can I get technical support?

To contact IOHK Technical Support, please submit a request using the [Submit a request form](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). On that page you can also click the Support button at the bottom right of your screen. The request form is better if you have a lot to write.
