Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano. We have an
active Telegram channel and a dedicated
[support page](https://iohk.zendesk.com/) to help you with your issues and
questions.

We are also creating documentation with the support of our pioneers, a small
group of stake pool operators. As that documentation is completed, we will add
it to the sections on this website. Please remember to check back regularly.

# Telegram Channel: Cardano Developers

You can reach the developers in Cardano community using links below:
- [Cardano Forums](https://forum.cardano.org/c/developers/)
