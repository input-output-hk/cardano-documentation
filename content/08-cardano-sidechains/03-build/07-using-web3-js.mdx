# Introduction  
Learn how to use the web3 Javascript interface with the Cardano EVM sidechain client for application development.  
Walk through an example program that demonstrates some sample API calls.  
  
The Ethereum web3.js interface provides many documented API calls.  
The interface gives you full access to a copy of the Cardano EVM Sidechain. You can create a website or client that uses a remote EVM sidechain node to interact with the decentralized blockchain ledger.   
The web3.js interface is also used to develop smart contracts in the Solidity language.  
  
In this example, we'll set up a simple Javascript program to demonstrate the concept.  
See the end of this page for more information. 
# Obtain permission to connect to a remote node
Follow the instructions on the [node authentication page](../network/node-authentication). 
You will receive a one-time access key that you must use within 24 hours.  
This process will authorize you to connect the machine you are currently using to the RPC URL (`http://faucet.mamba.atago/`). It's the same URL as the faucet.
  
If you have previously authenticated your machine, you can reestablish the connection to the VPN with this command:
```
sudo tailscale up --login-server https://headscale.pilz.iohkdev.io
```

# Running a sample application
Follow these steps to create and run a web3.js application that checks the synchronization status and displays the contents of the latest block.
## Set up the file structure
1. Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) are installed. There are plenty of instructional posts on the internet, so there is no need to repeat all that here.  
2. Create a new directory (its name does not matter) and initialize it. You can use npm or Yarn. Both npm and Yarn create the file `package.json`. At the same time, Yarn also creates `yarn.lock`, and npm creates `package-lock.json`. From here on, we will demonstrate using Yarn.  
On some systems, you are prompted for information that will be added to `package.json`. This information will be updated later when the web3 libraries are installed. You can just take the default values.    
On Windows:  
 ```
    c:\>mkdir Atago-web3-example
    c:\>cd Atago-web3-example
    c:\Atago-web3-example>yarn init

```
## Install the web3.js libraries
The web3.js libraries are available as an npm package, so you can use npm or Yarn to install them in the directory you just created.  
To install using Yarn:   
```
yarn add web3
```
## Check the contents of package.json
Compare your copy of `package.json` with this example. Make sure all the keys and values are there.

```
    {
        "name": "Atago-web3-example",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "main": "index.js",
        "license": "MIT",
        "dependencies": {
            "web3": "^1.3.6"
        },
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node index.js"
        }
    }
```
## Write the Javascript
On all systems, create a file called `index.js` in the same directory as `package.json`. Edit it so that it looks like this:  
```
    1 const Web3 = require('web3')
    2 
    3 let web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://faucet.mamba.atago"))
    4 web3.eth.getBlock('latest')
    5   .then((response) => {
    6     console.log('LATEST BLOCK:')
    7    console.log(response)
    8 })
    9   .catch((error) => console.error(error))
    10
```
`Index.js` is the Javascript program.  
Line 1 references the web3.js libraries.    
In line 3, we establish a connection between this program and the Cardano EVM sidechain node.  
In the block beginning at line 4, we retrieve the latest block that the client has downloaded so far.
## Test the program
Check that your connection to the EVM sidechain node on the Atago testnet is still active by accessing the URL in your browser.    

Go to the directory you have created and run the sample program.
```
    npm start
```
The result should be similar to this:  
```
    C:\>
    C:\>cd Atago-web3-example

    C:\Atago-web3-example>npm start

    > Atago-web3-example@1.0.0 start
    > node index.js
