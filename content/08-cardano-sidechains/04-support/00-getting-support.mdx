Your feedback is important because it helps us improve Cardano.

## Discord

If you have any questions or want to collaborate with fellow sidechain developers, join the `#ask-sidechains` channel in [IO Technical Communities Discord](https://discord.com/invite/inputoutput).

## Cardano Stack Exchange  

[Cardano Stack Exchange](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) is for questions and answers. It is a moderated community site. It is not for discussions; it is for technical questions with short answers. Do not ask for opinions - the Cardano forum is the place for opinions.  

There is a [dedicated page](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sidechains) for the tag `sidechains`. You can search on the tag to see questions that will interest you. Always search through existing questions and answers before asking a new question. Even if your particular problem does not have a solution yet, looking at similar problems can often result in a 'light bulb moment' for you.  

When you ask a new question, adding the tag to your question will make it easier for community members and IOG support staff to find your question. How you ask a question is important. Your objectives are to allow the support person to understand your problem in the shortest time possible and to allow others with a similar problem to find your question and its answers. For advice on how to ask a question, see the relevant [Stack Overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Solidity resources

When you develop for the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM), you write in the same Solidity language used by Ethereum developers and the same resources are available to you.

For example, you can ask questions on the [Stack Overflow website](https://stackoverflow.com/) and use the tag 'solidity'. You can also search for similar questions by typing `[solidity]` into the search box on the website. The result page of this search will give you the opportunity to watch the tag.
