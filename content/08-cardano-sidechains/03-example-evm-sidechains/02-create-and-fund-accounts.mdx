# How to fund your mainchain account with test ADA tokens

In this tutorial, you will learn how to claim test Ada tokens on the takao network (mainchain).

## Generating keys

To generate keys for the cardano testnet you need the `cardano-cli` [binary](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/)
Open a shell and run the following commands:

```shell
# Set network name
network=--testnet-magic=7

cardano-cli address key-gen \
    --verification-key-file payment.vkey \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey

cardano-cli address build \
    --payment-verification-key-file payment.vkey \
    --out-file payment.addr \
    $network

 export MC_ADDR=$(cat payment.addr)
```

These steps are based on the [cardano developers page](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/stake-pool-course/handbook/keys-addresses/).

To get test-Ada, submit the following request:

```shell
curl -X POST -s 'https://faucet.twokao.pilz.iohkdev.io/send-money/$MC_ADDR
```

# How to fund your sidechain account with test Fuel tokens

1.  Create a sidechain account using a compatible Web3 connected to the Atago network (MetaMask), 
1a. or using `mamba-cli`: https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-tooling

```shell
mamba-cli generate-keys --type ecdsa
```

(Add 0x to your public address)
