## Known issues

- If the sidechain network was added correctly, but MetaMask does not send transactions, update balance, or simply not interact with the chain, then try to [Reset your MetaMask account](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-reset-an-account).
- MetaMask compatibility with the sidechain is officially tested with Google Chrome and Brave web browsers. To avoid browser compatbility issues, use Google Chrome or Brave.
