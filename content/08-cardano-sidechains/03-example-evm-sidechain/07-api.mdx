Interacting with the sidechain requires sending requests to specific JSON-RPC API methods. The EVM sidechain testnet supports most standard Ethereum JSON-RPC API endpoints with a few exceptions described in the API specification.

## Specification

The EVM sidechain testnet supports [OpenRPC](https://open-rpc.org/)'s `rpc.discover` service discovery method that will return the OpenRPC scheme for the JSON-RPC API. You can easily validate and preview the schema on the [OpenRPC Playground](https://playground.open-rpc.org/) by passing your sidechain node's JSON-RPC URL:

```
https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=http://localhost:8546
```


*If your product requires a method that is not currently implemented, please contact Input Output Global support.*

# Not implemented yet  

- `eth_protocolVersion`  
- `eth_syncing`  
- `eth_coinbase`  
- `eth_feeHistory (This is specific to the London hard fork.)`  
- `eth_newFilter`  
- `eth_newBlockFilter`  
- `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`  
- `eth_uninstallFilter`  
- `eth_getFilterChanges`  
- `eth_getFilterLogs`  
- `eth_getLogs`  
- `eth_mining` (There is no “mining” in the Cardano EVM sidechain but it can return if the node is a validator.)  
- `eth_sign`
- `eth_signTransaction`  
- `eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex`  
- `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`
- `personal_importRawKey`  

The whole trace/debug module  

# Irrelevant methods

The following methods are irrelevant for the Cardano EVM sidechain because they are specific to proof of work. They can be implemented to return a fixed value if needed.  

- `eth_getUncleCountByBlockHash`  
- `eth_getUncleCountByBlockNumber`
- `eth_getWork`  
- `eth_submitWork` 
- `eth_hashrate`   
- `eth_submitHashrate`  
- `eth_getUncleByBlockHashAndIndex`  
- `eth_gasPrice`
