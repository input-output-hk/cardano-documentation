Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum. Because its syntax is similar to ECMAScript, it will be familiar to many developers. There are significant differences, including:

- Solidity is compiled rather than interpreted
- It is a statically-typed language
- It has variadic return types.
