The EVM sidechain testnet is EVM-compatible with most Ethereum software to develop and deploy smart contracts including:

- [Remix](#remix)
- [Hardhat](#hardhat)
- [Truffle](#truffle)

# Remix

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a Solidity smart contract to the EVM sidechain testnet using Remix. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is an online IDE to develop and deploy Solidity smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial, you will use MetaMask as your wallet and Web3 provider. If you have not done so already, [create or import an account with MetaMask](../01-metamask.mdx) and fund your wallet with testnet tokens using the [faucet](https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/).

## Step 1 - Configure Remix

- Visit the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). The left-hand side has a menu [1] and a typical file explorer [2]. The ` Solidity Compiler` [3] and `Deploy and run transactions` [4] plugins should be active by default.

![remix-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/200480707-ec8b8e69-6cdc-498b-b315-c029fbc2a564.png)

If the Solidity compiler and deploy plugins are not activated, you can search and activate them using the plugin manager [5] located in the bottom left of the screen.

![remix-plugin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/202550289-1cd1e25a-b1c9-4e66-9600-fad710126c8d.png)

Open MetaMask and double-check the sidechain testnet is the selected network. This will ensure Remix connects to the correct network when you configure your environment in the next step.

![select-network](../../../images/sc-metamask-select-testnet.png)

- In Remix, select the `Deploy and run transactions` plugin. Since you are using MetaMask as your Web3 provider, select 'Injected Provider' in the environment settings.

## Step 2 - The smart contract

With Remix configured to the sidechain testnet, you can move on to your smart contract development and deployment.

- In the Remix file explorer, create an `erc20.sol` file in the `contracts/` directory and input the following Solidity statements:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";


/**
* @title {Mintable ERC20 Token}
*/
contract MintableERC20 is ERC20("Mintable Token", "MT"), Ownable {
    /** 
    * @dev See (ERC20 - _mint) function for details.
    *
    */
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external payable onlyOwner() {
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

This smart contract describes a mintable ERC20 token using the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract libraries.

## Step 3 - Compile and deploy

- Using the `Solidity compiler` plugin [1], select 'compile' the smart contract [2].

When the contract is compiled, you can view contract ABI, Bytecode, and more information located in 'Compilation Details' [3].

![compile-remix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/200576656-dad4c35d-02f7-40ce-8bd1-3e9f8497e302.png)

- Then, select the `Deploy and run transactions` plugin > select 'Deploy' [1] and confirm any MetaMask prompts to sign the transaction. If the deployment is successful, the Remix console should return a green checkmark with expandable details [2]. The 'Deployed Contracts' panel will contain the contract address and generate a contract interface to test functions [3].

![deploy-remix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10556209/201174327-6be015b2-9003-4f3c-8d70-f376dd1a3a9a.png)

To verify that the smart contract was deployed on the sidechain testnet you can:

- Search the transaction hash or contract address on the EVM sidechain [testnet explorer](http://explorer.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/).
- Open MetaMask and see if the contract deployment transaction was successfully signed.
- Check Remix logs for deployment details.
  
# HardHat
This tutorial will show you how to deploy a Solidity smart contract to the EVM sidechain testnet using Hardhat. [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a popular development environment for Ethereum software.

- [Node.js v10](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/)

## Prerequisites

Hardhat is used in local NPM projects, so you will need NPM 7 or later.

- Install Node.js version 15 or later using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```
$ nvm install 15 --lts
$ nvm alias default 15
```

- Check Node and NPM versions:

```
$ node -v
v15.14.0
$ npm -v
7.7.6
```

## Step 01 - Create a Hardhat project

This tutorial will create a new NPM project and initialize `npx hardhat` to bootstrap a sample JavaScript project and configure it to deploy to the sidechain testnet.

- Create a new project:

```
$ mkdir Hardhat/
$ cd Hardhat/
```

- Initialize a new NPM project and install Hardhat locally:

```
$ npm init
$ npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

To create the sample JavaScript project, run `npx hardhat` in your project folder and select *Create a JavaScript project*.

```
$ npx hardhat

If you need additional information on using Hardhat, see official [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/).

## Step 02 - Configure Hardhat

Our sample JavaScript project contains a `hardhat.config.js` file. The `networks` config field is an optional object where network names map to their configuration and we can set `accounts` we want to sign transactions. For example:

```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */

const Private_Key = "INSERT_PRIV_KEY"

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    evm-sidechain: {
        url: `https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/`,
        accounts: [`0x${Private_Key}`]
    },
  },
  solidity: "0.8.17",
};
```

## Step 03 - Compile and deploy

- To compile Solidity files in the `contracts/` directory of your Hardhat project execute `npx hardhat compile`:

```
$ npx hardhat compile
```

Deploying with Hardhat utilizes deployment scripts located in `scripts/`. 

- To deploy with Hardhat, execute the deploy script with `evm-sidechain` as the network option.

```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network evm-sidechain
Greeter deployed to: 0x95E1C8F6C00d8cB518faBA33c8Ae814fc12E3090
```

🎉 Hurray! You deployed your smart contract to EVM sidechain testnet and can search your deployment on the [testnet explorer](http://explorer.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/).

# Truffle

This tutorial will show you how to deploy a Solidity smart contract to the EVM sidechain testnet using Truffle. [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/) is a popular development framework for EVM-based applications.

## Prerequisites

Install the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) version 8 or later.
- [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)

Check Node.js and NPM are installed:

```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```

Install Truffle and check whether it installed:

```
$ npm install -g truffle
$ truffle version
```

## Step 1 - Configure Truffle

You need to create a Truffle project before configuring Truffle to deploy on the EVM sidechain testnet. This demonstration will use the [React Truffle Box](https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/react/).

- Create a new project directory for your Truffle project and unbox the React Truffle Box:

```
$ mkdir React-Truffle
$ cd React-Truffle
$ truffle unbox react
```

- Configure Truffle to use the EVM sidechain testnet by adding the following in `React-Truffle/truffle/truffle-config.js` > Line 45. Remove the comment on Line 25.
- Replace `YOUR_SEED_PHRASE` with your mnemonic phrase.

## Step - Truffle Migrate

At this point, you've defined the EVM sidechain testnet and your testnet account to sign smart contract deployments. You are now ready to deploy!

- Within the `truffle/` directory of our project, execute `truffle migrate` while passing `evm-sidechain` for the `--network` parameter:

```
$ truffle migrate --network evm-sidechain
```

Upon executing `truffle migrate`, Truffle will return the transaction hash and contract address which can be searched on the EVM sidechain [testnet explorer](http://explorer.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/).
