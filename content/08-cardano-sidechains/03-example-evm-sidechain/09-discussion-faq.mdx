This page answers some frequent questions for the Cardano Sidechains Toolkit and the proof of concept EVM sidechain application.

## The Cardano Sidechains Toolkit

These questions relate to the components IOG provides for building custom sidechains on Cardano.

### Is the Sidechain Toolkit an open-source project?

Yes, the technical specification and proof of concept EVM sidechain client are open-sourced under IOG Github in this [repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sc-evm).

### Will there be an alternative chain follower to DB Sync that consumes less resources?

Yes, IOG is working in a less resource-intensive tool. There are other chain indexer tools such as [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura) and [Carp](https://github.com/dcSpark/carp) that could serve the purpose of building a Cardano sidechain.

## Cardano Stack Exchange  

[Cardano Stack Exchange](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/) is for questions and answers. It is a moderated community site. It is not for discussions; it is for technical questions with short answers. Do not ask for opinions - the Cardano forum is the place for opinions.  

There is a [dedicated page](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/sidechains) for the tag `sidechains`. You can search on the tag to see questions that will interest you. Always search through existing questions and answers before asking a new question. Even if your particular problem does not have a solution yet, looking at similar problems can often result in a 'light bulb moment' for you.  

When you ask a new question, adding the tag to your question will make it easier for community members and IOG support staff to find your question. How you ask a question is important. Your objectives are to allow the support person to understand your problem in the shortest time possible and to allow others with a similar problem to find your question and its answers. For advice on how to ask a question, see the relevant [Stack Overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
