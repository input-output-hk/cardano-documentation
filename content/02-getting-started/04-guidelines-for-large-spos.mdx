metaTitle: Guidelines for operating large stake pools
---

This section provides guidelines for operators of large stake pools,
specifically how to manage the risks and complexity of maintaining significant
stake or multiple pools. Operators of smaller stake pools may also find much of
this advice useful to them.

### Main recommendations

1. **Consider reliability and robustness**. Stake pools require high-reliability
   servers with:
   - Resilient compute capability.
   - Robust networking capability.
2. **Consider networking requirements** carefully:
   - High bandwidth connections are essential to run a relay node (e.g., 5
     Mbit/s + 0.1 Mbit/s per downstream peer as a capacity planning number).
3. **Operate sufficient relay nodes** as well as stake pools:
   - Relay nodes are necessary for the maintenance of the network.
   - Provision two relay nodes for each active stake pool.
4. **Be aware of system and network performance**, especially if using
   virtualized or shared servers:
   - Each stake pool may need its own dedicated hardware resources (compute,
     memory, and network).
   - It is recommended to use different servers for stake pools and relay nodes.
   - Virtualization may complicate the process of determining whether stake
     pools have adequate resources.
5. **Do not replicate stake pools** on the network:
   - Stake pool replication is adversarial behavior, which may lead to blocks
     being rejected.
   - Use high-reliability techniques to switch between duplicate or back-up
     servers without exposing both simultaneously to the network.
6. **Stake pools should have limited network connections**:
   - This reduces stake pool exposure to denial-of-service (DOS) attacks and
     improves performance.
   - Relay nodes should handle the larger portion of network traffic.
   - Stake pools should only be connected to trusted nodes (relay and/or stake
     generating).
   - Stake pools and relay nodes should restrict the services that are exposed
     (e.g., using a firewall).
7. **Security is paramount**:
   - Use _airgapping_ when signing transactions – do not store cold keys on an
     online server (including the one that is running a stake pool or a relay
     node).
   - Use hardware wallets for high-value private keys, where possible.
   - Where private keys cannot be stored in hardware wallets (e.g., cold keys),
     store them offline.
   - Be aware of and plan for enforced key rotations using the key evolving
     signature (KES) scheme.

### Managing risks and complexity

Operating stake pools effectively is crucial to ensure the long-term health and
liveliness of decentralization on Cardano. When a stake pool operator (SPO)
operates multiple stake pools (or has a single pool that directly controls a
significant percentage of the total staked ada), they may have a significant
effect on the overall system throughput as a consequence of the “proof-of-stake”
principle.

The Cardano design and security analysis assume that each stake pool operates in
a broadly independent and mutually supportive (non-adversarial) manner. This
means that large SPOs have a particular responsibility to ensure that their
operation supports the needs of the network as a whole. For this, it is
essential to evaluate and address common risks that may be experienced in stake
pool operations.

**Virtualization and containerization risks**

Because stake pools and relay nodes have specific real-time requirements, it is
generally not recommended to run Cardano nodes on virtualized resources without
undertaking careful performance, reliability, and security analyses. The mapping
of Cardano nodes to the underlying physical infrastructure must consider timing
issues for block production and propagation.

**Security and common-mode failures**

The risks of operating a stake pool using container-based virtualization include
increased chances of common-mode system failures, resource contention, and
increased exposure to security risks (including DOS attacks and loss of private
keys). The use of containerized environments, where relay nodes share the same
physical infrastructure as stake pool nodes, may impact real-time requirements
on block production and networking infrastructure, thus reducing stake pool
income. Moreover, concentrating network connections (as may happen with
virtualized or containerized services) increases the chances of a DOS attack, as
well as reduces network redundancy in non-obvious ways. In a virtualized or
shared environment, a single NIC/cable failure or DOS attack, for instance,
might then affect multiple stake pools or relay nodes, including those that
might be run by different SPOs.

**Shared resources**

The diffusion of a newly minted block causes a “pulse” of activity to occur.
Stake pools and relay nodes that share physical computing resources will be
forced to compete for shared CPU, memory, storage, networking, and other
resources. The demand for these resources is not smooth, it is correlated by the
block diffusion. This can negatively affect block production or result in
blockchain synchronization failures. Under some conditions, performance can
degrade in a non-linear way (e.g., adding a second node may reduce performance
by more than 50%). To eliminate such risks, it is important to analyze
performance requirements not only for the typical load but also for limit cases.

**Maintenance and upgrade**

System maintenance and upgrades should be always taken into consideration.
Although migration of a virtualized instance to new hardware, or duplication of
a running instance might seem easy, this commonly results in some timing
disruption. This is more significant in a real-time setting (such as Cardano)
than for typical data processing applications, which often have high levels of
replication and redundancy. System upgrades may also have unexpected effects on
the virtualized system’s performance, or occasionally, functionality. SPOs,
therefore, need to be aware of underlying system maintenance and take
appropriate action to avoid losing blocks (and income).

**Geographical and physical concentration**

Virtualized systems are often concentrated into a few large data centers. This
creates potential points of common network failures, including reliance on
specific portions of national infrastructures (internet backbones, power grids,
etc). Large SPOs should aim to disperse their operations across multiple
regions, and very large operators should aim for a global presence.

### Provisioning

To ensure overall network resilience and robustness, SPOs that operate large
stake pools must take special care of:

**Stake pool configuration**

1. Network configurations should ensure sufficient connectivity to other stake
   pools (including those that are run by other operators).
2. The effects of virtualization should be considered carefully: given the
   pulsed-nature of block diffusion, it is easy to overload physical compute,
   memory, and networking resources. Unlike a typical database or web service
   operation, Cardano stake pools have real-time compute and networking
   requirements. Failure to observe these requirements may have an impact on
   stake pool returns. It is generally not recommended to share server resources
   between multiple stake pools or relay nodes.
3. Stake pools should always be supported by sufficient relay nodes (two or
   more). This reduces the risk of a single relay node failure, which can
   potentially isolate a block-producing node. Failure of a block-producing node
   should only affect block production for that single stake pool. It is
   particularly important that large SPOs take on this responsibility since they
   are receiving a higher proportion of the operating rewards for the network.
4. To support the relay capacity scaling, it is desirable to use DNS names that
   map to multiple IP addresses and/or use multiple on-chain DnsName entries.
   Ideally, these entries should be supported over disjointed network
   infrastructure (e.g., different ISPs or physical paths).

**Security preferences**

1. Cold keys should never be stored on active servers (especially cloud
   servers).
2. Payment keys should be kept separate from block signing keys. Airgaps should
   be maintained between stake pools and systems used for transaction signing.
3. Hardware wallets or other secure means should be used to protect cold keys.
   One hardware wallet may be needed per set of keys (e.g., per stake pool), and
   these may need to be physically secured.
4. Back-up keys should be also securely maintained for each stake pool.

**General advice**:

1. Consider hardware performance, including memory, storage, and networking
   capabilities.
2. Perform failure-mode-effects analysis to ensure that single failures of a
   delivery component are suitably constrained.
3. Carefully consider containerization and virtualization performance to
   eliminate excessive contention for common resources (e.g., CPU cores).
4. Submit stake pool certificates that include both the IP address and DNS
   names.
5. Ensure that suitable monitoring is in place:
   - Receiving the vast majority of (>90%) blocks within 4,000ms of their
     associated slot time.
   - Track block production times to ensure that allocated resources remain
     sufficient (this will increase as transaction rates and block sizes
     increase).
6. Plan the expansion of relay nodes (potentially at a different location) that
   are associated with your stake registration (DDoS mitigation / rapid
   increases in load due to increase of delegation to SPO’s stake pools, etc.).
7. Plan for regular maintenance events (to minimize stake pool downtime and/or
   to perform maintenance when the leadership schedule indicates a good
   interval).
8. Plan and exercise disaster recovery every 3 to 6 months.
9. When operating multiple stake pools, spread out your block producer nodes
   across multiple continents to limit block production disruption and eliminate
   large-scale network outages.

#### Example system and relay topology configurations

There is no standard system configuration as every stake pool has different
operational requirements and preferences. It is the choice of an SPO on how to
configure the topology.

However, taking into account the earlier advice, it is recommended that an SPO
maintains at least two and an additional relay node(s) per a stake pool. In the
case of running multiple stake pools, it is best that SPOs use geographically
diverse peers, spread relay nodes across the world, and reach out to other SPOs
(particularly other large ones) making agreements to add each other's relay
nodes. The more SPOs they have peer-sharing agreements with, the more likely
their blocks will propagate and get included in the chain.

Monitoring is important for all SPOs, and it is essentially a responsibility of
an operator to ensure the quality of their pools’ functionality. As an example
of a monitoring process that reflects Prometheus rules alerting on thresholds,
one can take a look at the
[cardano-ops repository here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ops/blob/master/modules/monitoring-cardano.nix#L13).

**Example relay topology**

_Please note that IOHK relay nodes are outlined as examples._

```
{
  "Producers": [
	{
  	"addr": "north-america.relays-new.cardano-mainnet.iohk.io",
  	"port": 3001,
  	"valency": 4
	},
	{
  	"addr": "asia-pacific.relays-new.cardano-mainnet.iohk.io",
  	"port": 3001,
  	"valency": 4
	},
	{
  	"addr": "europe.relays-new.cardano-mainnet.iohk.io",
  	"port": 3001,
  	"valency": 4
	}
  ]
}
```

#### Node configuration options

The `MaxConcurrencyDeadline` configuration option controls how many attempts the
node will run in parallel to fetch the same block. Considering that getting the
same block as soon as possible is important for both relay nodes and block
producer nodes, we recommend setting the MaxConcurrencyDeadline value to 4.

### Delegation and pledging advice

**Delegation**

Stake delegation is the process of allocating individual stakeholders’ funds to
collective stake pools. Delegation is performed for block production purposes to
ensure that the block creation complies with the _proof-of-stake_ consensus. By
delegating, stakeholders do not transfer stake ownership, voting or other
rights.

Large SPOs will generally control a significant amount of third-party stake to
maintain trust in the blockchain, thus being responsible for:

- producing blocks
- processing transactions
- maintaining the Cardano network
- ensuring that the owner pledge is made
- securing the pool (e.g., protecting its private keys)
- providing public communications about the pool, including retirement
  announcements, changes in pricing or other pool parameters.

Large operators are not responsible for distributing block production rewards to
delegators as this is handled automatically by the blockchain. SPOs are also not
responsible for securing delegator keys or taking delegation, voting, or other
actions on behalf of stakeholders. Individual stakeholders must take personal
responsibility for their own security and must make their own decisions in terms
of delegation, voting, etc.

**Pledging**

Pledging is an important mechanism for producing Cardano’s healthy ecosystem.
SPOs may opt to pledge some, or all, of their ada to the pool in order to make
it more attractive to other delegators, and thus to grow the size of the pool as
a whole. Pledged ada may be supplied either by an SPO or by other owners.

**Pledging rewards**

Pledge influences the rewards that a stake pool can earn, and thus the rewards
that delegators can obtain from the pool. The pledging amount may be specified,
if desired, during the pool registration, and can then be changed on an
epoch-by-epoch basis. No minimum pledge is required, however, there is also no
maximum pledge.

Given two equivalent stake pools, the one with the greater pledge will earn more
rewards, and therefore be more attractive to other delegators. However, the SPO
or other pool owners should collectively meet the pledge by delegating. It is
also important to ensure that there are enough funds in addresses that use the
pool owner's address(es) as stake reference. **Failure to meet the pledge** will
mean that no rewards can be earned for the pool by any owner or delegator. This
will generally result in loss of delegation and _perhaps_ pool collapse.

_Unlike delegation, the SPO is responsible for distributing all pledging
rewards. This may be done in any agreed manner and is not enforced by the
blockchain_.

Collective stake pool operation (maintained by an operator and a group of
owners, pledging their stake) requires mutual trust and is a good way to build a
larger pool while sharing the risks and rewards.

**Defense against Sybil attacks**

The pledging mechanism is designed to mitigate against
[Sybil attacks](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2018/10/29/preventing-sybil-attacks/),
which could theoretically allow a proof-of-stake network to be taken over
without supplying a significant personal stake. By making pools with higher
pledges more attractive, such attacks are prevented. The pledge formula is
designed so that a pool with a higher pledge will produce higher rewards and
thus become more attractive. To conduct a Sybil attack, an adversary must divide
their pledge amongst a large number of pools. Since this will dilute each pool
pledge, delegators will be motivated by the rewards mechanism to re-delegate to
non-adversarial pools.
