## ACTUS
  Algorithmic Contract Types Unified Standards. A taxonomy and standard for financial contracts.

## ada

digital currency of the [Cardano blockchain](https://cardano.org/). One ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces.

## address
  a data-structure used in transaction outputs to convey various pieces of information. All addresses carry a network-discriminant tag to distinguish between different networks (e.g., mainnet or testnet) and a proof of ownership (i.e., a proof of who owns the transaction output). Some addresses also carry delegation choices or script references.  

## Adrestia
  Adrestia is a collection of products which makes it easier to integrate with Cardano. It is made of several application programming interfaces (APIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and software development kits (SDKs). Alternatively, Adrestia may also refer to the team working on the project itself.
  
## asset

a digital item of property that holds value stored in the distributed ledger. An
asset can represent security or utility tokens of fungible or non-fungible
nature.

## balance wallet

a wallet that stores your initial testnet ada balance, copied from the mainnet
via the balance snapshot. The stake from this wallet cannot be delegated but can
be transferred to and delegated from a Rewards wallet.

## Basho

fourth phase of Cardano development in which performance improvements will be
integrated.

## BFT

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), is a property in the system that ensures there
is resistance to certain types of failures. A BFT system can continue to operate
even if some nodes fail or malicious behavior occurs.

## block

a slot that contains a set of recent transactions on the network. Each block
also contains data required to manage the blockchain such as an encrypted
version of the previous block. As each block is completed, a new block is
created to extend the chain.

## Byron
  first 'bootstrap' phase of Cardano development.

## CFD
  contract for difference. Part of a wider group of trading products known as derivatives, they are a popular method of trading stocks, bonds, and commodities that allow you to speculate on the price.
  
## chain

a set of blocks that have been produced and are connected to another in
consecutive order.

## consensus

the process by which a majority opinion is reached by everyone who is involved
in running the blockchain. Agreement must be made on which blocks to produce,
which chain to adopt, and to determine the single state of the network.

## controlled stake

the total amount of stake that a stake pool controls. It combines the stake that
is owned by the pool operator with any stake that has been delegated to the pool
by other ada holders. It can be measured as a total ada amount (e.g., 3 million ada), 
or as a percentage of the total supply of ada within the network (e.g., 5%).

## cost per epoch

a fixed fee, in ada, which the stake pool operator takes from the
pool rewards every epoch to cover the costs of running a stake pool. The cost per epoch is
subtracted from the total ada  rewarded to a pool, before the operator
takes their profit margin. Whatever remains is shared proportionally among the
delegators.

## Daedalus

a secure wallet for the ada cryptocurrency that manages balances and provides
the ability to send and receive payments. [Daedalus](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/daedalus-wallet) is a full node wallet, which
means that it downloads a *full* copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently
validates every transaction in its history. It has a friendly user interface and
is recommended for new users to start with.

## DApp

decentralized application.

## DeFi
  decentralized finance refers to financial instruments and mechanisms built on the blockchain using smart contracts. Examples include atomic loans, swaps, bonding curves, and escrow.

## delegation

the process by which ada owners can participate in the network and earn rewards
by [delegating the stake](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/how-to-delegate) associated with their ada holdings to a stake pool.

## epoch
  a defined group of slots that constitute a period of time.
  
## EUTXO
  [extended unspent transaction output](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/) model of Cardano.

## faucet

a web-based service that provides free tokens to users of a testnet.

## fee

amount of ada or other cryptocurrency charged for transaction processing.

## fungible token/asset

an asset that is interchangeable and indistinguishable with some other asset(s).
Same denomination bills and coins are fungible assets, for example, like equal
quantities of ada to lovelaces.

## Goguen

third phase of Cardano development in which smart contracts will be delivered.

## hard fork

a change of the network’s protocol changing the state of operational
flow from one model to a completely different one.

## incentive

a way to encourage participants in the system to engage in the network by
rewarding them with a return that is proportional to their efforts. Incentives
aim to ensure equality and fairness in a distributed network of participants by
encouraging consistent, active, and strong participation. Cardano's incentives
model uses game theory to calculate the incentives required.

## interoperability
  one of the significant features within Cardano development that aims to enable interconnection between numerous blockchains and legitimate recognition of activities by central authorities. Enabled cross-chain transfers and the establishment of the internet of blockchains will grant enhanced user experience and functionality.
  
## IOG
  Input Output Global, also reffered to as Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), is a technology company committed to using peer-to-peer innovations to provide financial services to the community. In particular, IOG is working on the technology development for Cardano. 
  
## key pair

a set of two keys: public verification key and private signing key. These keys
are used to process and approve transactions within the blockchain.

## ledger
  a distributed database operated in a decentralized manner by multiple nodes across numerous locations.
  
## live stake
  the total amount of stake that a stake pool controls. It combines the stake owned by the pool operator with any stake that has been delegated to the pool by other ada holders. It can be measured as a total ada amount (e.g., 3 million ada), or as a percentage of the total supply of ada within the network (e.g., 5%).

## lovelace

the smallest unit of ada, equivalent to one millionth of one ada. A lovelace is
to ada what a satoshi is to bitcoin.

## mainnet

the live blockchain that has been deployed and is in operation. Assets held on
the mainnet hold value as opposed to assets on a testnet that do not hold value.

## Marlowe
  a domain-specific programming language (DSL) that is built on top of Plutus functionality. [Marlowe](https://docs.cardano.org/marlowe/learn-about-marlowe) can be used for financial purposes. There is a friendly [Marlowe playground](https://docs.cardano.org/marlowe/marlowe-get-started) - an environment where non-technical users can easily execute smart contracts prewriting specific conditions.
  
## Marlowe Playground
  the browser-based sandbox environment for end-to-end financial smart contract development. Its purpose is to encourage all types of developers, even if you don’t have prior Haskell or Javascript experience, to build financial products on Cardano. A [set of tutorials](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/doc/marlowe/tutorials/index.html) is available that outlines example contracts and overview information on Marlowe and how contracts should be modelled. 
  
## metadata

a set of additional data stating certain transaction conditions or owner
details. In smart contracts, metadata represents conditions under which a deal
should execute. In a non-fungible token, metadata can store owner ID, ownership
status, or intellectual rights.

## network

the technical infrastructure combining Cardano nodes and their relative
interactions in one unified system.

## non-fungible token

a unique asset that is not interchangeable with any other asset(s). Non-fungible
assets represent specific information (IP rights for example), and act as one
unit that cannot be divided into smaller fractions.

## OBFT

Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol. See BFT.

## Ouroboros

the consensus protocol underlying Cardano. There are several different
implementations including Classic, Praos, Genesis, and more recently Hydra for
scalability.

## P2P

peer-to-peer. Sending transactions or sharing files directly between nodes in a
decentralized system without depending on a centralized authority.

## peer discovery

the process by which nodes find each other on the network and initiate contact.

## performance

a measure of the efficency of a stake pool, given as a percentage, is measured
by how many blocks the stake pool has produced (and that are recorded on the
main chain) compared to how many it was nominated to produce. For example, if a
pool only produces half the number of blocks that were nominated, its
performance rating is 50%. This could happen because the pool has a poor network
connection, or has been turned off by its operator. Performance ratings make
more sense over a longer period of time.

## Plutus

a Turing-complete programming platform for writing functional smart contracts on
the Cardano blockchain. Plutus is based on the Haskell programming language.

## produced blocks

the number of blocks that have been produced by a stake pool in the current
epoch. Stake pools are rewarded in ada for each block that they produce.

## profit margin

the percentage of total ada rewards that the stake pool operator takes before
sharing the rest of the rewards between all the delegators to the pool. A lower
profit margin for the operator means they are taking less, which means that
delegators can expect to receive more of the rewards for their delegated stake.
A private pool is a pool with a profit margin of 100%, meaning that all the
rewards will go to the operator and none to the delegators.

## proof of stake

a type of consensus mechanism used to reach agreement on records in the
blockchain. It ensures distributed consensus based on the stake, or wealth, that
is held by participants in the system. This stake is used as the main resource
to determine the participant’s power in the system for maintaining the ledger.

## protocol

a term used for consensus reaching methods. For instance, Ouroboros protocol,
OBFT protocol.

## reward

an amount contained in each new block that is paid out to the stakeholder by the
network.

## rewards wallet

a wallet that stores ada which can be used in stake delegation. The stake from a
single Rewards wallet can only be delegated to a single stake pool. To delegate
to more than one stake pool, you will need to create multiple Rewards wallets
and distribute ada among them.

## saturation

a term used to indicate that a particular stake pool has more stake delegated to
it than is ideal for the network. Saturation is displayed as a percentage. Once
a stake pool reaches 100% saturation, it will offer diminishing rewards.The
saturation mechanism was designed to prevent centralization by encouraging
delegators to delegate to different stake pools, and operators to set up
alternative pools so that they can continue earning maximum rewards. Saturation,
therefore, exists to preserve the interests of both ada holders delegating their
stake and stake pool operators.

## securitization

the process of creating liquid, asset-backed securities from pools of illiquid
assets.

## security token

a digital asset that derives its value from an external asset that can be
traded. Usually, it represents stocks, bonds, or revenue participation notes.
Security tokens are subject to federal law governing regulations.

## Shelley
  second phase of Cardano development in which network decentralization was delivered.
 
## slot
  a fixed period of time within an [epoch](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/cardano-nodes#howdoesitwork?). Each epoch is divided into numbered slots. Slots that are inhabited by blocks are called *active* slots. 
 
## slot leader
  elected node that has been selected to create a block within the current slot. A random election process occurs based on the proportional stake.

## smart contract
  an automated agreement, written in code, that tracks, verifies, and executes the binding transactions of a contract between various parties. The transactions of the  contract are automatically executed by the smart contract code when predetermined conditions are met. Smart contracts are self executing and reliable and do not require the actions or presence of third parties. The smart contract code is stored on, and distributed across, a decentralised blockchain network, making it transparent and irreversible.
  
## stake pool
  a reliable block-producing server node that holds the combined stake of various stakeholders in a single entity, or pool.

## testnet
  a test network where users can experiment with new features and code and provide their feedback before a live mainnet launch. A testnet can be run locally or in some cases a public one is used.

## token
  cryptographic token that represents a footprint of value defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity. A token can be fungible or non-fungible, and act as a payment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder. 

## tokenization 
  the process of representing real-world assets with digital tokens.

## token minting
  the process of creating new tokens.
  
## tps
  transactions per second.

## transaction
  an instance that represents the process of sending or receiving funds in the system. 

## treasury
  a virtual pot where 5% of all earned rewards go every epoch. During the Voltaire era, treasury reserves will be used for further development, system improvements, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of Cardano. 

## tx
  see transaction. 

## utility token
  a digital token that holds certain functionality in regards to a concrete project or environment. These tokens can be used as payment units, rewards, or grant access to a specific network. 

## UTXO
  unspent transaction output. 

## Voltaire
  fifth phase of Cardano development in which treasury and governance capabilities will be delivered. 

## Yoroi
  a light wallet for Cardano that is used to manage ada balances and conduct transactions. A simple, fast, and secure wallet for daily use purposes that is developed by Emurgo.
