A cryptocurrency wallet is a safe and secure place where users can keep their
digital currencies.

> _Remember, only a wallet that you have private keys to (a password that
> provides access to your cryptocurrency) is considered to be safe to store your
> personal funds. It is highly **not recommended** to store cryptocurrency on
> exchanges, as this increases the risk of funds loss._
>
> _Not your keys, not your coins ‒ they say._

Cryptocurrency wallets come in different forms, from desktop and mobile
applications to hardware (USB-like) devices and paper wallets. All wallets are
designed to enable the storage of cryptocurrency and to allow the sending and
receiving of funds. Technically, cryptocurrency is not stored in the wallet ‒
its records live on the blockchain, and can be accessed using unique private
keys, which grant the right to make transactions. Losing your private keys means
losing access to your digital funds. That is why it is crucial to keep your keys
safe and offline.

The difference between the wallet types lies in their security and supported
functionality. Paper wallets are the most secure, for example, but not as
convenient in use; some wallets support a limited number of currencies, some
lack certain features (like delegation, for instance).

Let's take a closer look at the pros and cons of different wallet types:

- **Paper wallets** — these are paper documents that contain public and private
  keys details. Such documents can be stored in a safe place and are highly
  secure as they can’t be compromised via online attacks. Paper wallets are best
  to use for long-term savings. On the other hand, the funds linked to paper
  wallets are not possible to operate online (for purchases, for example), as
  they will have to be moved to other wallets first.
- **Hardware wallets** — these are devices that store cryptocurrencies offline
  and can be connected to a computer to access the funds. Hardware wallets are
  secure and their benefit lies in the balance of offline security and
  convenience as they can be carried around and used when needed. The
  disadvantage of the hardware wallet is the risk of device loss or damage.
- **Online wallets** — these wallets can be commonly set up using a browser.
  They work through the internet and store cryptocurrency in a certain
  application or software. This is convenient as users can send, receive, and
  use crypto as in any other bank account or payment system. However, online
  wallets are more open to security issues and can be compromised or attacked.
  _Search online for the most secure and suitable wallet; always keep your keys
  offline and use 2FA verification where possible (giving preference to security
  keys over SMS verification)._
- **Desktop wallets** — these wallets can be downloaded on a personal computer.
  They are secure and convenient in use. Before choosing the best-matching
  solution, it is important to ensure that your computer meets software
  requirements and that the wallet supports the cryptocurrency you would like to
  work with. Desktop wallets are easy to use, but are not as flexible or
  portable.
- **Mobile wallets** — these are wallet applications that can be installed
  directly on a smartphone. Such wallets are simple to install and use and is a
  good additional option for cryptocurrency storage.
