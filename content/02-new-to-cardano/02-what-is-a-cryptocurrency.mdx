A _cryptocurrency_ is a digital asset, which is stored on the ledger and is
designed to serve as a medium of exchange for goods or services. It is otherwise
called _crypto_.

Blockchain ledgers serve as the underlying technology for cryptocurrency
creation in a decentralized environment. Blockchain protocols use rigorous
cryptography techniques to enable the minting (creation) of cryptocurrency and
to secure and verify crypto ownership and fund movement records. The price of
cryptocurrency is not controlled by a government or centralized financial
institution. It is defined by its value, correlation to real-world figures, and
is driven by market supply and demand.

Addresses are used when sending cryptocurrency payments. They are unique
identifiers and are represented by a string of numbers and letters that are
obtained from the user's public keys.

### Ada is the native currency of Cardano

Each blockchain ledger has its underlying cryptocurrency or native currency. Ada
is the native, or principal currency on [Cardano](https://cardano.org/). This means that ada is the main
payment unit on Cardano; it is accepted as fee-payment, to make deposits, and is
also the only currency in which rewards are distributed.

Lovelace is the smallest denomination of ada. One ada = 1,000,000 lovelaces. Ada
has six decimal places, which makes it easily divisible into smaller fractions.

### Native tokens 

Cardano also supports the creation of native tokens ‒ digital assets that are
created for specific purposes. This means that users, developers, and businesses
can use the Cardano blockchain to create tokens that represent a footprint of
value (whether defined by the community, market state, or self-governed entity).
A token can be fungible (interchangeable) or non-fungible (unique), and act as a
payment unit, reward, trading asset, or information holder.
