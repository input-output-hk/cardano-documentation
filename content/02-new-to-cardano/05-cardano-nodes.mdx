The [_Cardano node_](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-node) is the top-level component within the network. Network nodes
connect to each other within the networking layer, which is the driving force
for delivering information exchange requirements. This includes new block
diffusion and transaction information for establishing a better data flow.
Cardano nodes maintain connections with peers that have been chosen via a custom
peer-selection process. By running a Cardano node, you are participating in and
contributing to the network.

### How does it work?

[_Stake pools_](https://docs.cardano.org/core-concepts/stake-pools) use the Cardano node to validate how the pool interacts with the
network and are responsible for transaction processing and block production.
They act as reliable server nodes that hold and maintain the combined stake of
various stakeholders in a single entity.

**Producing a block**

The goal of blockchain technology is the production of an
independently-verifiable and cryptographically-linked chain of records (blocks).
A network of block producers works to collectively advance the blockchain. A
[consensus](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/consensus-explained) protocol provides transparency and decides which candidate blocks
should be used to extend the chain.

Submitted valid transactions might be included in any new block. A block is
cryptographically signed by its producer and linked to the previous block in the
chain. This makes it impossible to delete transactions from a block, alter the
order of the blocks, remove a block from the chain (if it already has a number
of other blocks following it), or to insert a new block into the chain without
alerting all the network participants. This ensures the integrity and
transparency of the blockchain expansion.

**Slots and epochs**

The Cardano blockchain uses the [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf) protocol to facilitate consensus
on the chain. Ouroboros Praos divides time into epochs. Each Cardano epoch
consists of a number of slots, where each slot lasts for one second. A Cardano
epoch currently includes 432,000 slots (5 days). In any slot, zero or more
block-producing nodes might be nominated to be the slot leader. On average, one
node is expected to be nominated every 20 seconds, for a total of 21,600
nominations per epoch. If randomly elected slot leaders produce blocks, one of
them will be added to the chain. Other candidate blocks will be discarded.

**Slot leader election**

The Cardano network consists of a number of stake pools that control the
aggregated stake of their owners and other stakeholders, also known as
*delegators*. Slot leaders are randomly elected from among the stake pools. The
more stake a pool controls, the greater the chance it has of being elected as
a slot leader to produce a new block that is accepted into the blockchain. This
is the basic concept of proof of stake (PoS). To maintain a level playing field, and prevent a situation where a small number of very large pools control the majority of stake, Cardano has an incentive system that discourages delegation to pools that already control a large portion of the total stake.

**Transaction validation**

When validating a transaction, a slot leader needs to ensure that the sender has
included enough funds to pay for that transaction *and* must also ensure that the
transaction’s parameters are met. Assuming that the transaction meets all these
requirements, the slot leader will record it as a part of a new block, which
will then be connected to other blocks in the chain.
