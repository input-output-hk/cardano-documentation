Since Cardano is a public blockchain ledger, it is possible to easily track all
recent transactions, block details, and epoch data using different tools.

### Exploring transactions and blocks

**Cardano Explorer**

[Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/en) is a user-oriented tool that
fetches data from the main database and reflects it in a straightforward and
convenient web interface.

The Explorer shows the latest epoch details. You can click the latest epoch and
see:

- a number of blocks produced during this epoch
- time the epoch started
- time of last produced block
- number of processed transactions
- total output in ada

By choosing a specific block, you can explore it in more detail to see its ID,
size, epoch and block details, number of included transactions and
confirmations:

You can also search for specific epochs, transactions or blocks by pasting their
IDs in the search field.

> Note: IOHK has developed a stake pool metadata aggregation server [(SMASH)](/getting-started/operating-a-stake-pool/SMASH) to provide the community with a list of verified stake pools with valid metadata. Smash is integrated with the Daedalus wallet, and users can see a list of valid stake pools in the delegation center tab.
