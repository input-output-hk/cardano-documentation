Here are some general best practices that you should follow when developing smart contracts with Plutus.

**Knowing the objective of your smart contract**  
Know *exactly* what your smart contract should do and test it to ensure that it fulfills the expected objective. 

**Check if previous, similar contracts exist**  
Does a contract that does the same thing already exist? If so, what is different about your smart contract?
 
**Naming**  
Choose a clear and meaningful name for your smart contract. Keep it short and simple, and try to use the name to convey what the contract does.
 
**Peer review of code**  
The benefits of code review are well known; reviewed code leads to consistency across the project, defect-free, and code optimized for performance. The knowledge of the code is shared among developers, reducing maintenance time and cost in the future. For smart contracts, correctness is absolutely crucial.
 
**Testing on a testnet**  
You should always test your smart contracts on a testnet environment before running them on the mainnet. Write as many test scenarios as you can and run several iterations of your tests. To set up an Alonzo testnet [see script examples here](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/scripts/README.md#scripts-overview).
 
**Documenting test cases**  
Keep a list of the test cases that you run so that you have them for reference and verification purposes.
 
**Consider Formal Verification**  
The subject of formal verification is too large to adequately cover here. You can assume that your code will run in a hostile environment where highly skilled, well-resourced, and unscrupulous actors will be waiting to pounce on any vulnerability.
