Plutus is the native smart contract language for Cardano. It is written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are effectively Haskell programs. 

Alonzo is the name of the protocol upgrade that will introduce support for Plutus smart contracts on Cardano. This is currently in the final stages of development and we are working on lots of new content to help users on board with Plutus. Instructional material will be published here when Alonzo is released.

In the meantime, you can try out the [Plutus Playground](https://playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/) to learn how to write Plutus programs and use the [tutorials](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/index.html) to assist you. You can also read the [Plutus explainers](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/explanations/index.html) to learn more about the Plutus language.
