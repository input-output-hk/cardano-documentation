Concurrency may or may not improve a system’s performance, throughput, or responsiveness. The amount of concurrency limits the maximum number of simultaneous operations that can be performed. 

To obtain *actual* performance improvements in a UTXO-based blockchain, processors or other actors should be able to perform multiple actions simultaneously. The higher the level of concurrency, the higher the maximum possible parallelism. Such an approach then translates to performance improvements and throughput. It also provides significant advantages over account based systems (like Ethereum).

## Deploying DApps on UTXO ledgers is *different*

Cardano’s approach to DApp deployment is different and thus it requires a learning curve and a different approach. This is like working with different programming languages: there is one goal – to deploy a solution, but so many programming languages to use for this purpose. 

Maximizing concurrency is a skill that needs to be learned: developers need to write code in a way that severely restricts the opportunities for contention (e.g., by avoiding shared states and accidental dependencies). The system must then translate this concurrency into parallelism. A number of developers have already identified ways to approach this, while others are still developing solutions. Simply transplanting lessons learned on one blockchain will not work; while the learning curve is a little steeper, the results make this worthwhile.

Either way, it is important to understand that to deploy a scalable DApp on Cardano, a developer can’t just use an adapted Ethereum contract. Cardano is based on the UTXO model; it is not account-based which means that a single on-chain state will not meet the concurrency property of Cardano. Instead, DApps should split up their on-chain state across many UTXOs. This will increase the concurrency in their application, thereby allowing higher throughput. 

To learn more about scalability, you can read [how to design a scalable Plutus application](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/howtos/writing-a-scalable-app.html) and to find out more about how to organise DApps on Cardano using patterns, you can read the [order book pattern](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/explanations/order-book-pattern.html).
