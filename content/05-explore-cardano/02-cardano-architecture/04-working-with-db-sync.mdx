The purpose of this document is to explain how Cardano users can retrieve
blockchain data from the database. Here, we look into the ways of working with
the PostgreSQL database and explore its various queries.

### How to retrieve data from the DB Sync PostgreSQL database

#### Installation Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL library. This can be installed on Linux using e.g.
  `apt install libpq-dev`.
- PostgreSQL server. This can be installed on Linux using e.g.
  `apt install postgresql`.
- Сardano-node package. This provides the core Cardano node functionality and
  runs as a passive node.
- Сardano-db-sync package. This acts as a library for database support and
  connects to the Cardano node.

Alternatively, you can run these components using Docker: the `cardano-db-sync`
repository contains a
[docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
file, which lets you start the node, Postgres, and db-sync with a single
command:

`docker-compose up`

### How to set up and access the database

1.  You will first need to install
    [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2.  Create the database and
    [manage schemas](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/schema-management.md).
3.  Build and run the
    [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) and
    [cardano-db-sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/building-running.md).

- [JOINs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/tutorial-join.html)

### How to get data from the tables

On-chain data is stored in tables the mapping of which is structured
(normalized) in a way that avoids data duplication. However, this also means
that to extract certain data (like transaction information, for example), you
will need to
[join multiple tables in a query](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/tutorial-join.html).

To show all tables, run this command:

`\dt`

To show details about a specific table:

`\d+ TABLE_NAME`

Use the queries from the section below to get the blockchain data you are
looking for.

**Using DB management tools**

Another convenient way to explore database tables is to use a DB management tool
like [https://www.pgadmin.org/](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

This tool allows browsing the tables and their definitions (like foreign key
dependencies) or developing and executing complex queries.

Follow the
[getting started instructions](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/index.html)
to set everything up. Now you can use the queries listed below to get the
blockchain data you are looking for.

### Useful queries
