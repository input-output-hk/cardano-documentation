This section outlines some best practices for using the [Cardano DB Sync
component](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-db-sync).

### Purpose of Cardano DB Sync

The cardano-db-sync component is designed to work with a locally running [Cardano
node](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-node). The purpose of Cardano DB Sync is to follow the Cardano chain and fetch
information from the chain and an internally-maintained copy of ledger state.
Data is then extracted from the chain and inserted into a PostgreSQL database.
SQL queries can then be written directly against the database schema or as
queries embedded in any language with libraries for interacting with an SQL
database.

Here are some examples of what you can do with a Cardano DB Sync instance on a
specific network:

- Retrieve details of any block, transaction, address, or stake pool on that network, usually by the hash that identifies that item or the index into another table.
- Get the balance of any stake address for a specific epoch.
- Check the amount of ada that is delegated to each stake pool for a specific epoch.


For details of sample queries, see
[Sample Cardano DB Sync queries](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/interesting-queries.md).

**System requirements**

The system requirements for cardano-db-sync (with both db-sync and the node running on the same machine are:
Any of the big, well-known Linux distributions (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, Arch, etc.)
16 Gigabytes of RAM.
4 CPU cores.
80 Gigabytes or more of disk storage (preferably SSD, which are 2-5 times faster than electro-mechanical disks).
The recommended configuration is to have the db-sync and the PostgreSQL server on the same machine. During syncing (getting historical data from the blockchain), there is a huge amount of data traffic between db-sync and the database. Traffic to a local database is significantly faster than traffic to a database on the LAN or remotely to another location.

To run Cardano DB Sync, you first need to run a full Cardano node.  
For more information, see the [building and running instructions](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/building-running.md).


**Sample Cardano DB Sync queries**

We have compiled a list of [sample SQL queries](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/interesting-queries.md) that you can run against the DB Sync database.

You can run these queries using psql. You can connect to the database from the Cardano DB Sync git checkout using:

```
PGPASSFILE=config/pgpass-mainnet psql cexplorer
```
