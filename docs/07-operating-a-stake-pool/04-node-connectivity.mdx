Nodes connect to each other within the Cardano networking layer, and this
connection is essential for information exchange about transactions and new
block creation.

## Cardano networking

Cardano's networking evolved from its initial federated structure to hybrid and
the current Dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) model. Networking will keep evolving with
future additions such as Ouroboros Genesis and peer-sharing. See
[this explainer](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/p2p-networking)
for more details about network evolution and Dynamic P2P.

In a previous hybrid setup, SPOs could configure a node to connect to, for
example, 50 other SPO nodes. This is a pretty large number, since many nodes can
be offline, change their addresses, etc. While 20 connections are enough for
efficient communication, SPOs had to over-provision because of the static
configuration.

In a Dynamic P2P setup, SPOs can target to configure 20 connections, which can
be picked from thousands of SPO relays, not just 50. And if any are offline, or
go offline, the setup will automatically pick new ones, to meet the set target.
This means that the configuration is no longer limited to a static pool of 50
peers.

P2P also allows for more sophisticated configurations for direct peering
arrangements between SPOs. For example, if two SPOs want to maintain a
connection between their relays, and each has two relays, they can configure a
group of peers that lists the other SPOs’ two relays but with a target that
there should be at least one connection. This means that there is no need for
over-provisioning, and SPOs still get automatic failover if one relay goes down.
With static configuration, one had to choose between listing only one and thus
not getting resilience, or listing both and over-provisioning (using more
resources).

## Connecting core and relay nodes

As a stake pool operator, you will have two types of nodes: core nodes and relay
nodes. Each core node must be accompanied by one or more relay nodes.

The difference between the two types is that core nodes are responsible for
producing blocks, while relays are responsible for communicating with other
relays in the network and broadcasting blocks. This difference determines how
they are configured and how they are connected to the network.

A core node is configured with various key-pairs and an operational certificate
needed for block generation. It only connects to its relay nodes.
