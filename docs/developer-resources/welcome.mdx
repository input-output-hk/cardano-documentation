Welcome to the developer resources section! Here you will find references to the
resources that will help you with developing on Cardano.

## Getting started

- To get started, head over to the
  [Developer portal](https://developers.cardano.org/). There, you will find
  guides and tutorials on how to
  [install](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/installing-cardano-node)
  and [run](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/running-cardano) the
  Cardano node and
  [create simple transactions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/create-simple-transaction).
- Alternatively, explore the
  [Cardano course](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course) material.

## Interfacing with Cardano

There are various ways to interact with the Cardano node:

- Via the official command-line interface (CLI) –
  [cardano-cli](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli)
- Via a proxy interface like [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/) (JSON/WebSocket) or
  the
  [submit-api](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-submit-api)
  (CBOR/HTTP)
- Via an SDK/library such as
  [cardano-api](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api) (Haskell),
  [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) (Rust),
  [Yaci](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci) (Java), or
  [ouroboros-network-js](https://github.com/StricaHQ/ouroboros-network-js)
  (JavaScript).

You can also rely on third-party services and managed API query layers such as
[Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/), [Koios,](https://www.koios.rest/)
[Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/), or
[FreeLoaderz](https://freeloaderz.gitbook.io/freeloaderz-docs/).

For more tools, refer to the most commonly used
[builder tools](https://developers.cardano.org/tools) on the developer portal or
see this
[list of community-built developer tools](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/a-list-of-community-built-developer-tools-on-cardano).

## Native tokens

To start working with native tokens, see:

- [Developer portal native token tutorials](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/native-tokens/)
- [Ledger explanations about native tokens](https://cardano-ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/index.html).

You can also explore Cardano assets using a variety of [explorer tools](/about-cardano/new-to-cardano/cardano-tracking-tools#exploring-assets).


## Smart contracts

To start working with smart contracts, see:

- [Developer portal smart contract tutorials](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/)
- [Plutus Core documentation](https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

There are also many languages you can use to develop smart contracts:

- [Aiken](https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken) (Rust-like language)
- [PlutusTx](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/plutus/tree/master/plutus-tx) (Haskell-based language for high assurance)
- [Marlowe](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano) (TypeScript),  [Plu-ts](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts) (TypeScript)
- [OpShin](https://github.com/OpShin/opshin) (Python)
- [Scalus](https://github.com/nau/scalus) (Scala).
