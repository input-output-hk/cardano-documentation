Welcome to the developer resources section! Here you will find references to the resources that will help you with developing on Cardano.

## Getting started

-   To get started, head over to the [Developer portal](https://developers.cardano.org/). There, you will find guides and tutorials on how to [install](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node) and [run](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/running-cardano) the Cardano node and [create simple transactions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/create-simple-transaction).
-   Alternatively, explore the [Cardano course](https://cardano-course.gitbook.io/cardano-course) material.

## Interfacing with Cardano

There are various ways to interact with the Cardano node:

-   Via the official command-line interface (CLI) – [cardano-cli](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-cli)
-   Via a proxy interface like [Ogmios](https://ogmios.dev/) (JSON/WebSocket) or the [submit-api](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-submit-api) (CBOR/HTTP)
-   Via an SDK/library such as [cardano-api](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-api) (Haskell), [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) (Rust), [Yaci](https://github.com/bloxbean/yaci) (Java), or [ouroboros-network-js](https://github.com/StricaHQ/ouroboros-network-js) (JavaScript).
    
You can also rely on third-party services and managed API query layers such as [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/), [Koios,](https://www.koios.rest/) [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/), or [FreeLoaderz](https://freeloaderz.gitbook.io/freeloaderz-docs/).

For more tools, refer to the most commonly used [builder tools](https://developers.cardano.org/tools) on the developer portal or see this [list of community-built developer tools](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/a-list-of-community-built-developer-tools-on-cardano).
