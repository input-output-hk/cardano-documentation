:::

Plutus is the native smart contract language for Cardano. It is a
Turing-complete language written in Haskell, and Plutus smart contracts are
effectively Haskell programs. By using Plutus, you can be confident in the
correct execution of your smart contracts. It draws from modern language
research to provide a safe, full-stack programming environment based on Haskell,
the leading purely-functional programming language.

## Plutus smart contracts

Plutus smart contracts consist of parts that run on the blockchain (on-chain
code) and parts that run on a user’s machine (off-chain or client code).
Off-chain code can be written using the Plutus Application Framework (PAF), and
this code is then compiled by the GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler), whereas
on-chain code is compiled by the Plutus compiler into Plutus Core.

## Accounting model used by Plutus

Cardano uses the
[extended UTXO accounting model (EUTXO)](https://ucarecdn.com/3da33f2f-73ac-4c9b-844b-f215dcce0628/EUTXOhandbook_for_EC.pdf)
which extends the unspent (U) transaction (TX) output (O) accounting model
(UTXO) model (used by Bitcoin). In the UTXO model, a _transaction_ has _inputs_
and _outputs_, where the **inputs** are unspent outputs from previous
transactions. As soon as an output is used as input in a transaction, it becomes
spent and can never be used again. The **output** is specified by an _address_
(a public key or public key hash) and a _value_ (consisting of an ada amount and
optional, additional native token amounts).

EUTXO extends the UTXO model by allowing output addresses to contain complex
logic to decide which transactions can unlock them, and by adding _custom data_
to _all_ outputs. This model offers unique advantages over other accounting
models. The success or failure of transaction validation depends only on the
transaction itself and its inputs and _not_ on anything else on the blockchain.
Consequently, the validity of a transaction can be checked _off-chain_ before
the transaction is sent to the blockchain. A transaction can still fail if some
other transaction concurrently consumes an input that the transaction is
expecting. However, if all inputs are still present, the transaction is
_guaranteed_ to succeed.

## Plutus Core

Plutus Core is the scripting language used by Cardano to implement the EUTXO
model. It is a simple, functional language similar to Haskell, and a large
subset of Haskell can be used to write Plutus Core scripts. As a smart contract
author, you don’t write any Plutus Core; rather, all Plutus Core scripts are
generated by a Haskell compiler plugin.

These scripts will be executed by nodes during transaction validation ‘live’ on
the chain. They will either lock EUTXOs in the form of validator scripts or as
minting policies, which control the minting and burning of native tokens.

In practice, when developing smart contracts, you will write validator scripts
in Haskell, which will then be automatically compiled into Plutus Core using a
GHC plug-in called Plutus Tx.

## Plutus and native tokens

Each native token comes with its own minting policy, which determines the
conditions under which tokens can be minted and burnt. Users can write minting
policies in Haskell and compile them to Plutus Core. During the minting or
burning process, the Plutus Core policy script is executed in the context of the
minting or burning transaction, and the script will have to approve or forbid
the action. This feature further accelerates the growth of non-fungible tokens
(NFTs) on Cardano by enabling the creation of much more complex minting policies
and allowing the creation of NFTs in a trustless manner.

## Advantages of Plutus

Plutus provides considerable security advantages. It delivers an easier, more
robust way to show that your smart contracts are correct and will not encounter
the problems found in previous smart contract language design.

Plutus enables a novel integrated approach to smart contract and distributed
application development that is more convenient and safer than previous
alternatives. Both the on-chain and off-chain code are based on the same
language. You use a uniform code base, which the Plutus toolchain then
automatically separates into on-chain and off-chain code and packages for
deployment.

Additionally, in contrast to Ethereum, Plutus supports user-defined tokens (both
fungible and non-fungible) natively which does not require an accompanying smart
contract.

## Plutus developer resources

### Plutus Core

Plutus Core is the scripting language embedded in the Cardano ledger. It forms
the basis of the Plutus Platform – an application development platform for
developing decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano blockchain.

**Developer resources**:

- [Plutus Core GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus):
  includes the implementation, specification, and mechanized metatheory of
  Plutus Core as well as Plutus Tx – the compiler from Haskell to Plutus Core.

**Associated links**:

- [Talks](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#talks)
- [Specifications and design](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#specifications-and-design)
- [Academic papers](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus#academic-papers)

### Official Haskell language server implementation

Haskell language server implementation is an implementation of a server for the
Language Server Protocol (LSP). A language server talks to a client, who can ask
the server to perform various operations, such as reporting errors or providing
code completions.

**Developer resources**:

- [Haskell language server documentation](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Haskell course

Plutus Core is written in Haskell. To use Plutus,
it is essential to know the basics of Haskell. To help with the onboarding
journey, IOG's education team created the Haskell course for beginners. You can
find the repository with explainers, links to lectures, and more below.
