Aiken is a new programming language and toolchain for developing smart contracts
on the Cardano blockchain. It draws inspiration from various modern languages,
like Gleam, Rust, and Elm, renowned for their friendly error messages and an
overall excellent developer experience.

The language is exclusively used for creating on-chain validator scripts. Users
will need to write their off-chain code for generating transactions in another
language, such as Rust, Haskell, JavaScript, Python, etc.

As a language, Aiken is purely functional with static typing and type inference.
This means most of the time, the compiler is smart enough to determine the type
of something without requiring user annotation. It also allows the creation of
custom types resembling records and enums. Aiken does not include higher-kinded
types or type classes because it aims for simplicity.

On-chain scripts are typically small in size and scope compared to other kinds
of applications being developed today. Consequently, they do not necessitate as
many features as general-purpose languages that must tackle far more complex
issues.

Aiken is easier than Plutus to get started with for those who are less familiar
with functional languages like Haskell. Similar to Plutus, Aiken scripts are
compiled down to the untyped Plutus Core (UPLC).
