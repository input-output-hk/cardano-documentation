Cardano’s approach to price setting mainly relies on market demand over actual
supply. On Cardano, more than one type of
demand competes for the common supply. Thus, it is crucial to consider both
_relative_ and _absolute_ pricing. One way to do this is to inspect the effects
of smart contract pricing, non-fungible token (NFT) operations, and so on, with
respect to some common value – in our case, the consumption of Cardano’s
processing power.

The Cardano ledger's design is focused on high assurance, security, and proven
formal verification. In alignment with this strategy, it is also important to
ensure that transaction processing is _deterministic_, meaning that a user can
predict the impact and outcome of a transaction before its actual execution.

The ability to guarantee the cost of transaction execution and how the
transaction behaves on the ledger _before_ it is submitted became even more
prominent with the introduction of smart contract support in 2021. This feature is
different from other blockchains, including Ethereum, where other network
activity can influence the gas cost. This ability is also guaranteed by the
deterministic nature of Cardano and Plutus scripts.

## Determinism

_Determinism_, in the context of transaction and script processing, is a synonym
for predictability. This means that a user can predict locally (off-chain) how
their transaction will impact the on-chain state of the ledger, without
encountering the following:

- unexpected script validation outcomes or failures
- unexpected fees
- unexpected ledger or script state updates.

## Validation

An important aspect of processing a transaction is validating the actions it is
taking. A transaction is _taking an action_ when it contains data in the
specific field to that action. For example, a transaction is _spending UTXO U_
when it contains a reference to U in its input field, and it is _minting_ a
token X when its mint field contains X.

Cardano uses scripts to validate actions. These scripts, which are pieces of
code, implement pure functions with _True_ or _False_ outputs. _Script
validation_ is the process of invoking the script interpreter to run a given
script on appropriate arguments.

Script validation can be performed for the following actions:

- Spending a UTXO locked by a script address: the script that is run is the one
  whose hash forms the address.
- Minting a token: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the policy
  ID of the token being minted.
- Reward withdrawal: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the
  staking address.
- Applying a certificate: the script that is run is the one whose hash forms the
  certificate author’s credential.

Besides letting the node know which script to run, all transaction actions
indicate how to assemble arguments passed to that script. Alonzo introduced a
new approach to transaction validation on Cardano due to the implementation of
Plutus scripts.

## Ledger features

The Alonzo upgrade changed the data on the ledger as follows:

1. Plutus scripts can lock UTXOs.
2. A component, added to the contents of the output parts of UTXOs, enables
   script state-like functionality. In addition to assets and an address, a UTXO
   locked by Plutus scripts also contains a datum. A datum is a piece of data
   that can be thought of as an interpretation of the script state.
3. There are a number of protocol parameters used to impose additional
   validation requirements on transactions. These include upper limits on
   computational resources that scripts can consume.

To support Plutus scripts, transactions have the following features:

1. For each of its actions, the transaction carries a user-specified
   argument, called a redeemer. Depending on the script, a redeemer can serve a
   different purpose. For example, it can act as the bid the user places in an
   auction, or the user’s guess in a guessing game, among many other functions.
2. The transaction specifies computational execution budgets for each script.
3. To ensure that a transaction can pay its execution fee, Alonzo introduced
   collateral.
4. Transactions contain an integrity hash, needed to ensure that it has not been
   compromised, outdated, etc.

With the Vasil upgrade, Plutus scripts were upgraded to V2 functionality with an
improved cost model and new built-ins. The use of reference inputs, inline
datums, and reference scripts allowed for efficient throughput and significantly
increased performance.
[See the complete Vasil feature overview here](/evolution/upgrades/vasil).

The node performs the checks that ensure the transaction is constructed
correctly. For example, it must not exceed the maximum execution resource
budget. It also invokes the Plutus script interpreter to run the scripts.

The non-deterministic gas model can charge users unpredictably large fees. In
Cardano scripts, this source of indeterminism is addressed by requiring that the
resource budget itself, as well as the fee required to cover this budget, are
included in the transaction. Script execution necessarily returns either _True_
or _False_, and will not loop indefinitely. The reason for this is that every
operation a script performs takes a non-zero amount of resources, which are
tracked by the interpreter. If the budget specified by the transaction is
exceeded, script execution terminates and returns _False_.

The following key points make the outcomes of script and transaction validation
**predictable**:

- the script interpreter will always terminate and return the same validation
  result when applied to the same arguments
- a transaction necessarily fixes all arguments that will be passed to the
  script interpreter during validation
- a transaction specifies all the actions it is taking that require script
  validation
- compulsory signatures on a transaction ensure that it cannot be altered by an
  adversary in a way that causes scripts to fail
- applying a transaction in the EUTXO ledger model is deterministic.

Script validation failure or success does affect how a transaction is processed.
However, the _True_ or _False_ outcome, as well as ledger changes associated
with either outcome, are predictable for a given transaction.
