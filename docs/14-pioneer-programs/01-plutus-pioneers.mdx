> Before you start, note that Plutus Core, Cardano’s native smart contract

> In preparation, we recommend that you complete our new self-paced

> stepping stone course offers unique code examples and interesting exercises
> that have prepared solutions to help you can learn the fundamentals of

## What is the Plutus Pioneer program?

It is a program to recruit and train developers in Plutus for the Cardano
ecosystem. When you join this program, you will become part of a group with
access to a set of lectures that teach you the core principles of how to code in
both Haskell and Plutus. It is highly interactive, with weekly videos,
exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to the creators and key
experts in the language. You will also be able to join a dedicated community
channel, created to help pioneers connect with each other as you learn.

## What prior experience do I need?

This course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert
in formal methods, programming experience and a general aptitude for logical and
mathematical thinking are highly desirable. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or
functional programming is also recommended, as Plutus is heavily based on
Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level
programming, and effect systems. We recommend that you work through **IOGs**
official [Haskell Course](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell-course).
You can also read the [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) book.

## What can I expect to learn?

This course involves approximately ten hours a week of your time and efforts. It
covers the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including:

- Functions and data types
- Type classes
- Monads
- Template Haskell
- Extended UTXO model
- Working with Plutus (on and off the chain)
- Minting policies
- Some case studies and practical exercises

As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out!

## When can I join?

We have recently completed a very successful fourth cohort of this program and
will be launching another course later this year. Please register your interest
today using the form below to find out more details.

## How can I register for the Plutus Pioneer program?

If you are interested in joining a future cohort of this program, please
complete the registration form below and we will be in touch soon.

## Will I be certified?

Yes, we are working on certification for those pioneers who successfully
complete the entire program. Certificates will be represented as non-fungible
tokens (NFTs) (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can
demonstrate their qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to
unlock their individual token.

## Yes, I'm interested!
