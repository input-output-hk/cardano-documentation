A [stake pool](/learn/stake-pools) is a reliable server node that holds and
maintains the combined stake of various stakeholders in a single entity. Stake
pools use the [Cardano node](/learn/cardano-node) to
validate how the pool interacts with the network and are responsible for
transaction processing and block production.

Successfully operating a stake pool includes the roles of a stake pool operator
and one or more stake pool owner(s). It is important to note that there is a
conceptual difference between these two roles:

- A _stake pool operator_ is a person who is assigned responsibility for setting
  up and keeping the stake pool running, which means that they own or rent a
  server, hold the key of the stake pool, and hold responsibility for running
  and monitoring the node. With their key, a stake pool operator can sign
  blocks, register, re-register, or retire a stake pool, and post updated
  certificates. A stake pool operator is also empowered to exclude some stake
  pool owners during re-registration.
- A _stake pool owner_ is a person who pledges their stake to the pool to
  increase the pool’s reward earning capacity and desirability. The ability of
  the owner to [pledge stake](learn/pledging-rewards) provides protection
  against Sybil attacks.

Usually, the stake pool operator and the owner is the same person, however, a
stake pool can also have multiple owners, who pledge their stake to form one
larger pool to ensure it is competitive. Even in this case, there is still only
one stake pool operator who is responsible for stake pool processes.

It is essential that all stake pool owners trust a stake pool operator. All
operators’ and owners’ rewards are paid out into a single shared reward account
associated with the reward address of the pool. The holder of the rewards
account pays out rewards independently to the owners.

This makes it clear to all parties that an agreement is needed to define when
and how the accumulated rewards in a shared account should be split. For
example, they can agree to have the operator control the shared account, or they
could choose to use a multisig account.

To run a pool effectively, a bi-directional relationship and trust are crucial.
If this trust is broken, other parties can lose in regards to accumulated or
potential rewards, or reputation for the operator.

_Note, that to eliminate such a case, it is beneficial for owners and operators
to consider entering into contractual arrangements._
