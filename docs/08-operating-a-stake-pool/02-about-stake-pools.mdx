A [stake pool](/learn/stake-pools) is a reliable server node that represents the
combined stake of various stakeholders in a single entity. Stake
pools use the [Cardano node](https://docs.cardano.org/learn/cardano-node/) to
form the backbone of the Cardano network by processing transactions and validating and producing blocks.

Stake pool roles include a stake pool operator
and one or more stake pool owner(s). It is important to note the
conceptual differences between the two:

- A _stake pool operator_ is the owner of the cold and VRF signing keys used to create the stake pool. 
  The operator configures and maintains stake pool infrastructure and is responsible for monitoring it. 
  The operator can register, re-register, or retire a stake pool, update
  certificates, and ensure that the block-producing node can sign and validate blocks and process transactions.
- A _stake pool owner_ is determined by the stake signing keys used in stake pool creation. The owner's 
  [pledge stake](/learn/pledging-rewards) is intended to 
  provide protection against Sybil attacks.

Usually, the stake pool operator and the owner are the same person. However, a
stake pool can have multiple owners that choose to combine their pledge. It should
be noted that the stake pool's declared pledge must be met by the combined stake in the 
owner's wallets and failure to do so will result in the pool being unable to produce blocks.

All operator and owner rewards are paid out into a single rewards account
associated with the reward address of the pool. If a stake pool has multiple owners, it is
up to the owner of the rewards account to distribute rewards to the operator and 
other owners.

An agreement is likely needed to define when
and how the accumulated rewards in a shared account should be split. For
example, they can agree to have the operator control the shared account, or they
can choose to use a multisig account.

To run a pool effectively, a bi-directional relationship and trust are crucial.
If this trust is broken, other parties can lose in regards to accumulated or
potential rewards, or reputation for the operator.
